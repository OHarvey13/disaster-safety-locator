# 🏥 Healthcare Access Fairness Analyzer

This project investigates **healthcare access fairness** using machine learning.  
The goal is to analyze datasets related to healthcare availability, outcomes, and equity, and to build a deep learning model that predicts disparities or highlights underserved populations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data ingestion and preprocessing from public healthcare datasets
- Deep learning model for predicting healthcare access gaps
- Metrics for fairness and equity analysis
- Visualizations for insight into underserved populations
- Modular, well-documented code structure
